  # Fix RLS policies for admin_settings table

  This migration updates the Row-Level Security policies for the admin_settings table
  to allow operations for anonymous users, since this application uses passcode-based
  authentication rather than Supabase's built-in authentication system.

  ## Changes Made
  1. Drop existing restrictive policies
  2. Create new permissive policies for anonymous role
  3. Allow SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE operations for public/anon role

  ## Security Note
  This is appropriate for this application since it uses passcode-based admin access
  rather than user-based authentication. The passcode protection is handled at the
  application level.
